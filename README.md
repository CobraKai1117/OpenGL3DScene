**1. How do I approach designing software? **

When designing software, I tend to look at the overall big picture of how each part of the program will be connected. I try to map out the relations between each sections of the program. Once a framework is established, I can focus on fleshing out specific parts of the program. While coding these parts, I try to maintain the overall picture in my mind. 

Working with OpenGL differs from more traditional programming such as web/mobile development. It requires more abstract thinking and being able to imagine how each part of the program will work before it runs. It is much more difficult to detect problems and much harder to see potential issues without having an abstract model in your head. While it still needs improvement, OpenGL has helped me improve my abstract thinking. It also helped me identify areas for improvement as a developer.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

Once I've established a big picture of how the software is designed, I delve deeper into the more technical nuances of each part of the program. When possible I try to keep each function modular and separate  I also try to minimize function overhead by making sure each function is responsible for only a single task. With OpenGL, iteration plays an important part. The program itself will continue running until the user presses the escape key to exit. Until this happens, the program is stuck in a continuous while loop where all the main functionality occurs.  

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Having solid fundamentals of computer science can allow me to work on complex problems that I find interesting. This aptitude also allows me to grow as a developer and as a person. Each and every day software is used to make people's lives better and easier and I want to help develop that software. Being exposed to different types of programming such as graphics programming, helps to develop different throught processes and see different ways a problem can be solved. While I can't imagine myself going into graphics programming, I can still appreciate some of the concepts I learned in this class and respect the people who are graphics programmers.
